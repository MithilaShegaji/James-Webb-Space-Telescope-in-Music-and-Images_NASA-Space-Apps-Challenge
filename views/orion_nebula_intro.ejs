                    <h2>Orion Nebula Captured by JWST</h2>
                    <p>The Orion Nebula, as captured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), offers an awe-inspiring view of one of the most spectacular star-forming regions in the universe. Located about 1,350 light-years away from Earth, in the constellation Orion, the nebula is a stellar nursery, where new stars are born amidst clouds of gas and dust.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to JWST's ability to see in the infrared spectrum, the telescope pierces through dense dust clouds, offering a clear view of young, forming stars, protoplanetary disks, and complex gas structures. JWST reveals intricate details of the nebulaâ€™s structure that were previously unseen in such clarity, showcasing massive stars like those in the Trapezium Cluster.</p>
